SpinorHelicityPackages
======================

This repository is a collection of Mathematica packages,
used for the computation of the two-loop rational parts
of all-plus amplitudes using the separable approach.
Many of these packages are building on, and extending the
functionality of, the SpinorHelicity` package by
Manuel Accetulli Huber and Stefano De Angelis
(https://github.com/accettullihuber/SpinorHelicity).
For the moment we provide a customized version of an
old version of their package (with the authors permission).
In a future update, the packages will be made compatible with the
current version of SpinorHelicity`.
