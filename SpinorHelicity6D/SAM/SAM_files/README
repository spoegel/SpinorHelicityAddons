contain each 1000 randomly chosen rational kinematic points for one or two
massive scalar pairs, with the remaining momenta being massless.
For the massless momenta, the files provide both spinors and four-vectors.
Each point is given as an association, of the form

<|
    "Scalar1" -> {pS1, pS2},
    "Scalar2" -> {ps1, ps2},
    "Massless" -> {pg1, pg2,..},
    "MasslessSpinors" -> {{lambdag1,lambdaTildeg1},{lambdag2,lambdaTildeg2},..}
|>

where the SU(2) indices of the spinors are up for both the lambda and lambdaTilde.
In the case of one scalar pair there is only a single key "Scalars" instead of
"Scalar1", "Scalar2".

The file
    setupScalarKinematics.m

contains two functions

    SetupSAMTwoScalarMomentumKinematics
    SetupSAMFourScalarMomentumKinematics

to read in the kinematic points the functions after loading S@M.
As an example, in the case of two scalar pairs and two massless momenta, we can
assign one scalar pair the labels (p1,p2), the second (p3,p4), and the massless
momenta (p5,p6) through

    SetupSAMFourScalarMomentumKinematics[{p1,p2},{p3,p4},{p5,p6},kinematicsAssociation]

where kinematicsAssociation would be one of the points in fourScalar6PtPoints.m.


The file

    ATreeSAM.m

contains all relevant two- and four-scalar tree amplitudes in (almost) S@M notation.
Since S@M seems to automatically expand sums in spinor chains, I introduced to
symbol SumM, which represents the sum over slashed the matrices of its arguments.
For numerical evaluation one just has to perform the replacement {SumM->Plus}.

The amplitudes are available through the commands

    ATreeSAM["S","S","+","s","s"][p1,p2,p3,p4,p5]
    ATreeSAM["S","S","+","+","s","s"][p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6]
    ATreeSAM["S","S","+","s","s","+"][p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6]

etc.
The first set of arguments are the relative position of scalars and
gluons, and the second arguments are the momentum labels.
